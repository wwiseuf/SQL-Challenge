# SQL-Challenge
SQL homework

***** PLEASE READ BEFORE RUNNING DATA******

For the project I created a database in pg admin.  Created a schema and imported data using an app.  https://app.quickdatabasediagrams.com

set the primary and foriegn keys using the app 

To successfully run please use Tables schema in query tools as constraints were corrupt in original file and had to be reworked within pg admin's ERD function.   


Tools should have the correct CSV files links and will run without issues after the trouble shooting was complete.   

within the data was able to answer all questions requested for homework.
